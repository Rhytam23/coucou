// What the phone is told, and what it may decide.
//
// The hub holds the last list of sessions and the one permission request that is
// still waiting, as the island published them (phone_link_publish). It knows
// nothing about sockets or Tauri: connections subscribe to it, and a decision
// from a phone goes back to the app through the `Host` trait. That keeps every
// rule of docs/ANDROID_LINK.md testable without a window.
//
// The rules that matter:
//   * a phone decision is applied only if its fingerprint is the one of the
//     request that is *still* pending (same session, tool, command and request);
//   * only one decision is ever applied per request;
//   * a request older than APPROVAL_TTL is dismissed, whatever the phone says;
//   * nothing here can block the agent: the desktop's own card keeps working,
//     and a phone that never answers changes nothing.
