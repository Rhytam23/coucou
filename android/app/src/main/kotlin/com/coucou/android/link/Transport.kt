 *  - Without a relay, only the LAN is ever tried.
 *  - With one, the LAN is tried first with a short timeout, and the relay only when the LAN did not answer.
 *  - Having just found the LAN unreachable, the next reconnects go to the relay first for [LAN_SKIP_MS] (so a phone that is away
 *    does not wait out a LAN timeout every time), with the LAN as the fallback if the relay fails too.
 *  - While connected through the relay, the LAN is tried again every [LAN_PROBE_MS] and the link moves back to it.
